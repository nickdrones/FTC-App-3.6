     * Note that the REV Robotics Color-Distance incorporates two sensors into one device.
     * It has a light/distance (range) sensor.  It also has an RGB color sensor.
     * The light/distance sensor saturates at around 2" (5cm).  This means that targets that are 2"
     * or closer will display the same value for distance/light detected.
     *
     * Although you configure a single REV Robotics Color-Distance sensor in your configuration file,
     * you can treat the sensor as two separate sensors that share the same name in your op mode.
     *
     * In this example, we represent the detected color by a hue, saturation, and value color
     * model (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV).  We change the background
     * color of the screen to match the detected color.
     *
     * In this example, we  also use the distance sensor to display the distance
     * to the target object.  Note that the distance sensor saturates at around 2" (5 cm).
